# GitHub File Downloader Extension

## About
The GitHub File Downloader is a Chrome extension that enables users to download files from GitHub with a single click.

## How to Install (Unpacked Version)
To install the unpacked version of this extension, follow these steps:
1. Download or clone the extension files from the repository.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable 'Developer mode' at the top right corner of the page.
4. Click on the 'Load unpacked' button.
5. Select and open the directory where you downloaded/cloned the extension files.
6. The extension should now appear in your list of extensions and is ready to use.

## How it works

1. After installing the extension, pin it to the toolbar for easy access.
2. The extension is disabled by default for each new tab.
3. To enable the extension on a specific GitHub page, simply click the extension icon once. This action activates the extension for that particular page.
4. With the extension enabled, you can download any single file on GitHub by clicking on it.
5. To deactivate the extension and revert to the standard behavior, click the extension icon again.
6. Refreshing a tab resets the extension to its default state, which is 'off'.


## Limitations
- **Private Repositories**: Currently, the extension does not support downloading files from private repositories.
- **Files Starting with a Dot**: Files that begin with a dot (.) are not supported for download at this time.

These limitations are known, and plans are in place to address them in future updates of the extension.
